============
Installation
============

All you need is the file https://github.com/maccesch/djstorm/raw/master/djstorm.js (right click -> save as...)

Since there are no required libraries or frameworks just add the script to your project.

For example in a website:

.. code-block:: html

	<head>
		...
		<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/djstorm.js"></script>
		...
	</head>
