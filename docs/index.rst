.. dJStorm documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

===================================
Welcome to dJStorm's documentation!
===================================

This ORM is similar to the very elegant one of Django but this one is asynchronous.

For maximum compatibility it is completely framework agnostic.

Currently only the HTML5 Local Database is supported as backend. But due to the asynchronous architecture anything is thinkable.

Please note, that this is still in alpha stage. But feel free to try it out. You should already be able to use it in some real situations.

Any help in developing this further is welcome.
